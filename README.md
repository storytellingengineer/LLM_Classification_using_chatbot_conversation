# LLM Classification Finetuning
Finetune LLMs to Predict Human Preference using Chatbot Arena conversations



## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of user interactions from the ChatBot Arena. In each user interaction a judge provides one or more prompts to two different large language models, and then indicates which of the models gave the more satisfactory response. The goal of the competition is to predict the preferences of the judges and determine the likelihood that a given prompt/response pair is selected as the winner.

## Files
**train.csv**

- `id` - A unique identifier for the row.
- `model_[a/b]` - The identity of model_[a/b]. Included in train.csv but not test.csv.
- `prompt` - The prompt that was given as an input (to both models).
- `response_[a/b]` - The response from model_[a/b] to the given prompt.
- `winner_model_[a/b/tie]` - Binary columns marking the judge's selection. The ground truth target column.

**test.csv**

- `id`
- `prompt`
- `response_[a/b]`

**sample_submission.csv** A submission file in the correct format.

- `id`
- `winner_model_[a/b/tie]` - This is what is predicted from the test set.
